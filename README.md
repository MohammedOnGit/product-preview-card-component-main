## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS (Sass)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of SCSS, including the use of:

- **@font-face** for custom font loading
- **SCSS variables** for colors and font styles
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for layout structure
- **Responsive design** using media queries

Here's an example of how I structured font imports in SCSS:

```scss
@font-face {
  font-display: swap;
  font-family: "Montserrat";
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 500;
  src: url("./fonts/montserrat-v26-latin-500.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

And how I used SCSS variables for colors:

```scss
$Dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
$White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

body {
  background-color: $Cream;
  color: $Dark-grayish-blue;
}
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:

- Improve my understanding of **CSS Grid for complex layouts**
- Explore **more advanced SCSS features**, such as mixins and functions
- Enhance **accessibility practices** in future projects

### Useful Resources

- [SCSS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - A great resource for learning more about SCSS.
- [MDN Web Docs - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - Helped me understand the `font-display: swap` property for better performance.
